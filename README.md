# Hardware-Monitor-in-C-
Personal hobby project in which I aim to develop my own resource monitor that uses speach to let 
the user know how much system resources are being used during rendering for example. 

All code is C# and IDE is Visual Studio 2017. Code is ran from within the console for now but will
eventually be created into a full desktop app.
